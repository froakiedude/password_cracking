0.01 ms for each iteration
194433 words
n = number of words in out password
194433^n iterations
32 threads
each thread starts at an equidistant point in the dictionary and works its way up

to comb through every combination we need

(194433^n * 0.01) / 32 milliseconds

assuming 2 words this means to find every possible combination we need
11,813,809.84 milliseconds
or 11,813.81 seconds
or 196.90 minutes
or 3.28 hours

not bad!

if our combination lies near the starting position of one of our threads it will be computed very fast
